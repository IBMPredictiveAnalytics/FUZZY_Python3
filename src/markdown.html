<h1>FUZZY Extension Command</h1>

<p>Match cases from two datasets based on one or more keys drawing randomly from matching cases.</p>

<p>Note: the original version of this command was called CASECTRL.  FUZZY
is a superset of that functionality.</p>

<p>FUZZY /HELP  prints this output and does nothing else.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY DEMANDERDS=demand SUPPLIERDS = supply BY=agegroup gender
SUPPLIERID = id NEWDEMANDERIDVARS=supplierId.
</code></pre>

<p>Example using a single input dataset (the active dataset):</p>

<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY by=x1 supplierid = id newdemanderidvars=sid group=group
drawpoolsize=drawpool.
</code></pre>


<pre class="example"><code>FUZZY DEMANDERDS=demander SUPPLIERDS=supplier
BY=origin cylinder SUPPLIERID=id
NEWDEMANDERIDVARS=matchedcaseid
COPYTODEMANDER=mpg randomnumber randomstring
DS3=dsextra DEMANDERID=demanderid.
</code></pre>

<p>FUZZY takes two datasets, a demander and a supplier or a single dataset with a 
group identification variable.  It attempts to find a match for each
demander case from the supplier dataset based on the variables named in BY.  If more than one 
candidate matches, it picks randomly.  No sorting of either dataset is required.</p>

<p>If using a single dataset, the <strong>DEMANDERDS</strong> and <strong>SUPPLIERDS</strong> keywords
can be omitted.  The active dataset will be used.</p>

<p>By default, a match is defined by identical values for all the <strong>BY</strong> variables.  A system-missing
value prevents a case from being matched.  Fuzzy matching is also available for numeric variables.
Specify FUZZ=list-of-matching tolerances.  There must be one fuzz value for each BY variable,
listed in BY-value order.</p>

<p>A tolerance is the maximum difference in either direction that is allowed for a match.  Thus,
values of 1 and 2 would match if tolerance is 1 or more, and a tolerance of zero means an
exact match on that variable.  You must use 0 for any string variable.  If <strong>FUZZ</strong> is used,
rejection counts for each variable are show in the output.</p>

<p>By default, with fuzzy matching, an exact match is first tried, and then a fuzzy match is tried.
There is no attempt to get the closest fuzzy match, just a match within the tolerance.
<strong>EXACTPRIORITY</strong> = FALSE causes all suppliers within the fuzz range to be considered equally.
EXACTPRIORITY must be FALSE if MINIMIZEMEMORY is TRUE.</p>

<p>Using EXACTPRIORITY may introduce a subtle artifact that may need to be considered in
subsequent analysis.  While it will generally produce closer matches, cases with variable values 
where candidates are scarce will tend to get matches that differ more than where candidates
are abundant.</p>

<p><strong>CUSTOMFUZZ</strong> can be used to substitute a user-written calculation for the
built-in fuzzy calculation.  It should specify a Python module name and function
as a quoted string, e.g. &quot;mymodule.fuzzycalc&rdquo;.  The function should return</p>

<ul>
<li>0 - no match</li>
<li>1- fuzzy match.</li>
<li>It coudl also return 2 (exact match).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the case comparison produced an exact match, this function is not called.
The function signature should be
<code>functionname(demander, supplier)</code><br/>
where demander and supplier are lists of the BY variable values for the
demander and supplier cases.
Note that the function needs to deal with missing values (None) and may
need to handle both string and numeric comparisons.
The FUZZ subcommand is ignored if a customfuzz function is used.</p>

<p>The <strong>DEMANDERDS</strong> and <strong>SUPPLIERDS</strong> values can be the same, indicating that all the data
is in the same dataset.  In this case, <strong>GROUP</strong> must be used to distinguish the cases.
<strong>GROUP</strong> names a variable that indicates which are demander cases and which supplier ones.
A value of 1 indicates demander and 0 indicates supplier.  Any other values, including missing,
cause the case to be ignored.</p>

<p>This procedure builds some possibly large tables in memory, so it may not be appropriate for very
large datasets.</p>

<p>There are several output options.
The <strong>ID</strong> or IDs of matching cases are appended to the demander dataset variables.  The number of
variables listed as <strong>NEWDEMANDERIDVARS</strong> determines how many matches are attempted.  These variables
must not already exist in the demander dataset.</p>

<p>The variables in the supplier dataset that are listed in <strong>COPYTODEMANDER</strong> are copied to the 
demander dataset as new variables or replacement values.  For existing variables, the types 
must agree.  If no match is found, existing demander dataset values are not changed and new
variable values will be sysmis or blank.</p>

<p>COPYTODEMANDER cannot be used with GROUP.</p>

<p>Only one NEWDEMANDERIDVARS may be specified if COPYTODEMANDER is used.<br/>
None of the metadata such as variable and value labels is copied.  Use APPLY DICTIONARY 
to bring over variable properties.</p>

<p>If <strong>DS3</strong> is specified, a new dataset is created containing the cases in the supplier dataset actually 
used for the matches.  It will be the active dataset after the command is run.<br/>
DS3 cannot be used with GROUP.
(This implies that any unnamed dataset will be closed.)
It contains all the variables froom the supplier dataset plus the <strong>MATCHGROUPVAR</strong>.
If DEMANDERID is specified, it also contains the ID variable from the demander dataset.  These 
variable names must all be unique.
DS3 is only a dataset: use the SAVE command to turn it into a file.</p>

<p><strong>DRAWPOOLSIZE</strong> can name a variable for the demander dataset that will record the
number of cases in the supplier dataset that are eligible to match the demander case.
This can be useful in identifying the types of cases in terms of BY variables where
the supplier pool is thin.  The variable must not already exist in the demander dataset.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>By default, sampling from the supplier dataset is done without replacement.  Specify
<strong>SAMPLEWITHREPLACEMENT</strong>=TRUE to sample with replacement.</p>

<p>By default, memory usage is minimized in picking supplier dataset candidate match cases
(all eligible cases have an equal probability of selection).  This requires an extra data pass.  If
the possible number of matching cases for a demander case is small or the supplier dataset is
not large, specifying
<strong>MINIMIZEMEMORY</strong>=FALSE may improve performance by eliminating the extra data pass.  In the
case of 1-1 matching, this is recommended.
MINIMIZEMEMORY=TRUE cannot be combined with EXACTPRIORITY=TRUE.</p>

<p>When MINIMIZEMEMORY=TRUE, each supplier case is eligible for assignment at random 
to just one demander case for which it is within tolerance.  When FALSE, the case is 
eligible for all cases within the tolerance, and one is picked at random from all of those.
This means that when TRUE, a usually small number of demander cases may go unmatched
when a match could have been found, but when FALSE, the matching tables can become
very large, especially in the PSM case.</p>

<p>By default, cases in the demander dataset are processed in case order.  If there are insufficient 
supplier cases, you may specify <strong>SHUFFLE</strong>=TRUE to process the demander cases in random order.
This ensures that earlier cases do not have an advantage over later ones in matching.<br/>
SHUFFLE increases the memory requirement and will take longer to execute.</p>

<p>Use <strong>SEED</strong>=number to set the random number generator to a known state for repeatability.</p>

<h2>OUTFILE</h2>

<p>Matching can be quite time consuming.  Progress can be logged to a file during the run.
Specify a file/path as <strong>LOGFILE</strong>=&ldquo;filespec&rdquo; to record progress.
If <strong>LOGACCESSMODE</strong> is OVERWRITE, each run overwrites an existing file.  APPEND
appends to the log file.
The contents record the state the process has reached and writes the number of operations
completed at 1000 or 5000 case intervals for some operations.</p>
